# MMM-Asset-Portfolio
A <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror">MagicMirror</a> that utilizes the Alpha Vantage API to track the price of cryptocurrencies and stocks to then be added to a portfolio total.

## Features
1. Get data for any asset (Stocks or Cryptocurrency) listed on [Ahpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co)
2. Compilation of retreived assets
3. Display of total portfolio worth (Currently only in CAD)

## Installation
1. Navigate into your MagicMirror's `modules` folder and execute `git clone https://github.com/leviwillms/MMM-Asset-Portfolio.git`.
2. Add the module inside `config.js` placing it where you prefer

## Config
|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|`apikey`|MANDATORY: API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).<br>**Type:** `string`|
|`Stocks`|The stocks you want to display.<br>**Type:** `JSON array`<br>**Properties:** <br>**Name:**`The name of the stock you wish to display.`<br>**Symbol:**`The symbol of the stock you wish to display.`<br>**Quantity:**`The amount of the stock you own.`<br>**Default:**<i>[`{ name: "Tesla", symbol: "TSLA", quantity: 1}, { name: "Apple", symbol: "AAPL", quantity: 1}, { name: "Amazon", symbol: "AMZN", quantity: 1 }`]</i>|
|`Crypto`|The cryptocurrencies you want to display.<br>**Type:** `JSON array`<br>**Properties:** <br>**Name:**`The name of the crypto you wish to display.`<br>**Symbol:**`The symbol of the crypto you wish to display.`<br>**Quantity:**`The amount of the crypto you own.`<br>**Default:**<i>[`{ name: "Bitcoin", symbol: "BTC", quantity: 1 },{ name: "Ethereum", symbol: "ETH", quantity: 1 }`]</i>|

Here is an example config to insert into `config.js`
```
{
	module: "MMM-Asset-Portfolio",
		position: "top_bar",
		config: {
			apiKey: "Z7QJQLMUY8Y36K1M",
			stocks: [
				{ name: "Tesla", symbol: "TSLA", quantity: 1},
            	                { name: "Apple", symbol: "AAPL", quantity: 1},
                                { name: "Amazon", symbol: "AMZN", quantity: 1 }
			],
			crypto: [
				{ name: "Bitcoin", symbol: "BTC", quantity: 5 },
				{ name: "Ethereum", symbol: "ETH", quantity: 15 }
			],
		}
},
```
### Example

### Notes
- Due to API call limits if you wish to display both Crypto + Stocks you can only display a **maximum** limit of 5 assets. However, if you only choose to display one asset class all you enter into the config will be display, it will just add a 1 minute loading time for every additional 5 assets in the config after the additional 5.
- To keep within Alpha Vantage API call limites the update interval has been set to 30 minutes. This will be properly optimized in the future, along with the above issue adressed.
- The Alpha Vantage API call limitiations are 5/minute and 500/day.
- **IMPORTANT:** Unfortunately with the way I have currently created the module the prices are only able to be displayed and retreived in Canadian Dollars (CAD). This is obviously a big down side and it will be one of my main priorities as I continue development of this module. 

### Feedback
This is my first crack at building a Magic Mirror Module, there is still much to do in terms of optimization and additional features. This initial release is primarily to show as a part of my capstone project for my diploma. I plan to continue to work on this project, so please leave any feedback you can think in the forum. Thank you!
